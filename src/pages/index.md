# üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!

Welcome to the non-official [Astro](https://astro.build/) blog starter templatecreated by [Borja LoFe](https://github.com/borjalofe). This template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build a personal website,blog, or portfolio with Astro.

This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your`astro.config.mjs` file. You can customize your setup with [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations) to add tools like Tailwind,React, or Vue to your project.
		
Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:

- Edit this page in `src/pages/index.astro`
- Edit the site header items in `src/components/Header.astro`
- Add your name to the footer in `src/components/Footer.astro`
- Check out the included blog posts in `src/content/blog/`
- Customize the blog post page layout in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`

Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to [read the docs](https://docs.astro.build/) or [create an issue](https://github.com/borjalofe/astro-blog-template/issues) toask questions.
